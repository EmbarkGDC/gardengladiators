!!! note "Sample Game Environment"
    Reminder that Sapient integrates into your project. This means the results you get will reflect your projects architecture including code, assets, and project setup. Examples in the sample videos below use **Unreal Engine 5+** sample games. Specifically:

    - [Cropout Sample Project](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/cropout-casual-rts-game-sample-project)
    - [Third Person Shooter Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/third-person-template-in-unreal-engine)
    - [First Person Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/first-person-template-in-unreal-engine)

### System-Aware Intelligence

!!! tip "Key Feature"
    - Understands your project, your workflows, and your systems for personalized support.
    - Adapts to your specific game architecture and infrastructure.
    - Provides intelligent recommendations and optimizations tailored to your project.

!!! example "**Query:** "What is this game about?""
    Sapient returns detailed game-specific information about the sample game ([Cropout](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/cropout-casual-rts-game-sample-project)).
    It outlines the game's core systems, assets, and even the type and genre of game!

    ```
    ```text
    Please implement a double jump mechanic within my CharacterController class...
    ```
